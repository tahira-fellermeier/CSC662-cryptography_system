FUNCTION encrypt(plaintext, key):
    Change plaintext and key to all uppercase letters
    Remove any non-letter characters from key
    Make a repeated version of key to match the length of plaintext (skipping non-letters in plaintext)

    Start with an empty result
    FOR each letter in plaintext and matching letter in repeated key:
        IF the plaintext letter is a letter:
            Find how many steps to shift: add the position of plaintext letter and key letter in the alphabet
            Wrap around if it goes past Z (like a circle)
            Add the new letter to result
        ELSE:
            Add the plaintext letter as-is to result

FUNCTION decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    Change ciphertext and key to all uppercase letters
    Remove any non-letter characters from key
    Make a repeated version of key to match the length of ciphertext (skip non-letters in ciphertext)

    Start with an empty result
    FOR each letter in ciphertext and matching letter in repeated key:
        IF the ciphertext letter is a letter:
            Find how many steps to unshift: subtract the position of key letter from ciphertext letter in the alphabet
            Wrap around if it goes before A (like a circle)
            Add the new letter to result
        ELSE:
